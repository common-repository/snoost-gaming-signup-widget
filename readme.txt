= What is cloud gaming =

‘Cloud gaming’, also referred to as ‘game streaming’, is a method which lets you install and play a high-end PC game on a remote server, and then stream the video to your own device, allowing even low-end computers to play games at high graphics, since all it requires is a solid internet connection. You can create an account for free at [snoost.com](https://www.snoost.com/) and are more than welcome to leave feedback here on the WordPress site.
